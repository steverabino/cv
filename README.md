###Personal Statement
Hard-working, professional engineer, who has spent almost 10 years working in testing and QA roles in both permanent and consulting capacities. I am now looking to move into a developer role, to build upon experiences I’ve gained in test automation (Ruby), and projects outside of work (in Ruby and PHP).

###Development Experience

      I am one of a small team of engineers who are working on this project, the aim of which is to create a library of drawings made by child refugees, so they may be used to lobby for more funding towards children’s mental health initiatives amongst refugee populations. The app is built on a Ruby on Rails app, and provides an API in order to provide images and data with a wider audience, including the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX).

      The ACB Calculator is a web app (Ruby on Rails) I have created for a student doctor friend of mine. It is a tool used to calculate a patient’s Anticholinergic Burden (ACB) score based on the medicines they are taking. The app uses Javascript and JQuery to update a running score based on medicines entered and warn the user when the score hits a dangerous level. It also uses caching to work offline, as this is necessary in a hospital setting.

      UK Ultimate is the governing body of Ultimate Frisbee in the UK. I took over the technical running of their website in late 2012, and have been hosting, supporting, and providing patches and updates ever since. It is based on a Drupal framework (PHP), with some custom modules that I have expanded the functionality of. It is used by almost 4,000 members to pay annual fees and to keep up to date with UKU news and events.

      <strong>QA Engineer - Global Personals / Venntro</strong>
      <br>
      Manual and automation software testing in an Agile environment. As well as regular testing duties such as test scripting and execution across a range of platforms, I was involved in regular sprint planning and retrospectives, working closely with developers to help them fully understand requirements, forewarn them of edge-cases, and to review code changes. Additionally, writing and maintaining test automation scripts in Ruby on a Capybara framework, utilising Rspec and Selenium Webdriver, and implementing the continuous integration strategy, and configuration of Jenkins, the chosen CI tool. Git and GitHub used extensively, working on feature branches, and reviewing changes.
      <br><br>
      Projects were usually changes to the user-facing desktop and mobile dating websites built in ColdFusion and Ruby, which needed to take into account the huge number of different markets the websites are aimed at, and the different territories in which they operate. I also took the role of leading testing on financial projects, ensuring partners were being paid the correct amounts, correct statements were being produced for them (including correct VAT calculations), and that all financial exports from the system were able to be imported into the company’s chosen accounting package.

      <strong>Senior QA Engineer - Tribal Worldwide</strong>
      <br>
      A short contract helping to set up the test team on a large-scale overhaul of Volkswagen’s customer website and native apps. This involved preparing a team of six testers, mostly based in Eastern Europe, to work in an Agile way to complete incremental changes in short sprints, and pushing for changes in the way that development and testing were being performed. I also created a Rails app to show how often automation regression tests were failing.

      <strong>Test Analyst - BMT Defence Services</strong>
      <br>
      System Test planning (including estimation), execution, and analysis on small-scale projects for the MoD, as well as preparing Acceptance Test level scripts for customers. Projects tended to follow an Agile methodology, with short development and testing cycles favoured, which required me to be flexible, and work closely with different developers.

My role then included overseeing and contributing to the creation of over 700 test scripts over a two-week period, tracing these test scripts back to business and functional requirements, getting involved in the actual testing, and taking the lead on daily defect meetings with the supplier; assigning actions to individuals, and delivering daily status reports.

      I was primarily the Test Lead on Contracts Finder, a brand new .NET website delivered by a 3rd party developer in Cardiff. My role was to script and perform the UAT cycle of testing, report defects back to the developers, and report progress to the Project Manager within Serco. I tested the initial build of the site, a massive undertaking, a couple of bug fix releases, and a new API for third party data feed providers to use. I also performed confirmation and regression testing on dates when new code was released to the live environment on all the Business Link websites, which were based on a customised TeamSite CMS framework. The testing was mostly manual, though I was also able to use the Firefox Selenium IDE add-on to record and run automated tests on the sites to check user journeys and create test data.

      <br><br>
      This led me to a spell as a Test Analyst, preparing and executing manual IST and UAT test conditions using HP Quality Center as a test and defect management tool. The technology under test was a web-based life insurance quotation solution, and its interactions with a variety of back-end applications such as ALIS (a life assurance policy administration application) and Siebel (a customer relationship management application).

###Interests and Hobbies
Outside of work, I like to play Ultimate Frisbee, a non-contact team sport I picked up at university, and have been playing ever since. It is great exercise, and I really enjoy being part of a team. I play for Thundering Herd, a mixed-gender team based in Clapham. I am also a keen traveller, both for Frisbee tournaments, and for my own pleasure.
<br><br>
I’ve also spent a lot of time recently trying to improve my development skills. Two of the most recent courses I have been following along with that have provided me with a wealth of knowledge have been Mackenzie Child’s 12 web apps in 12 weeks, which has given me a foundation in working with Ruby on Rails, and Wes Bos’ Javascript 30, which I have completed to give me a better understanding of JavaScript.
