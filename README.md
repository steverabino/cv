###Employment History
<table>
<tr><td width=22% valign=top>Jun 2013 – Dec 2014</td><td><strong>QA Engineer (contract) – Global Personals</strong><br>Tower House, Southampton Street, London WC2E 7HA</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>Manual and automation software testing in an agile / Scrum environment. As well as regular testing duties such as test scripting and execution across a range of platforms, I was involved in regular sprint planning and retrospectives, working closely with developers to help them fully understand requirements, forewarn them of edge-cases, and to review code changes. Additionally, writing and maintaining test automation scripts in Ruby on a Capybara framework utilising Rspec and Selenium Webdriver, and implementing the continuous integration strategy. Git and GitHub used extensively for version control, to work on feature branches, and to review changes.
<br><br>
Projects were usually changes to the user-facing desktop and mobile websites written in ColdFusion and Ruby, which needed to take into account the huge number of different markets the websites are aimed at, and the different territories in which they operate. I also took the role of leading testing on financial projects, ensuring partners were being paid the correct amounts, correct statements were being produced for them (including correct VAT calculations), and that all financial exports from the system were able to be imported into the `Infor SunSystems` accounting package.</td></tr></table>

<tr><td colspan=2>System Test planning (including estimation), execution, and analysis on small-scale projects for the MoD, as well as preparing Acceptance Test level scripts for customers. Projects tended to follow an agile methodology, with short development and testing cycles favoured, which required me to be flexible, and work closely with different developers. Projects were usually web-based (ASP.net), and test management performed on Team Foundation Server.</td></tr></table>

<br>
Leading the Integrated System Test phase of the brand new DoH Foundation Programme Application System, a web-based system for placing medical students into NHS Trust placements. This engagement started with me assisting in the creation of an Excel-based test and defect management tool using formulae and basic VBA to meet the needs of the project. My role then included overseeing and contributing to the creation of over 700 test scripts over a two-week period, tracing these test scripts back to business and functional requirements, getting involved in the actual testing, and taking the lead on daily defect meetings with the supplier; assigning actions to individuals, and delivering daily status reports.</td></tr>

<table><tr><td width=22% valign=top>Aug 2010 - Jul 2011</td><td><strong>IT Test Analyst – Serco (businesslink.gov.uk)</strong><br>Riverside House, London SE1 9HA</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>I was primarily the Test Lead on Contracts Finder, a brand new .NET website delivered by a 3rd party developer in Cardiff. My role was to script and perform the UAT cycle of testing, report defects back to the developers, and report progress to the Project Manager within Serco. I tested the initial build of the site, a massive undertaking, a couple of bug fix releases, and a new API for third party data feed providers to use. I also performed confirmation and regression testing on dates when new code was released to the live environment on all the Business Link websites, which were based on a customised TeamSite CMS framework. The testing was mostly manual, though I was also able to use the Firefox Selenium IDE add-on to record and run automated tests on the sites to check user journeys and create test data.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td width=22% valign=top>Sep 2007- Aug 2010</td><td><strong>IT Graduate / IT Test Analyst - AXA</strong><br>Marlborough House, Bristol BS1 3NX</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>I spent my first 2 years at AXA on an IT graduate scheme, consisting of placements in various business units and IT functions. Placements included a phase as Defect Manager on a £2,000,000+ project to bring automated underwriting to customers at the point of sale, Business Analyst on a project introducing 3rd party Windows-based software to administer an innovative pension product, and Test Analyst on a web-based insurance policy tracking feature for customers.
<br><br>
This led me to a spell as a Test Analyst, preparing and executing manual IST and UAT test conditions using HP Quality Center as a test and defect management tool. The technology under test was a web-based life insurance quotation solution, and its interactions with a variety of back-end applications such as ALIS (a life assurance policy administration application) and Siebel (a customer relationship management application).

###Interests and Hobbies
Outside of work, I like to play Ultimate Frisbee, a non-contact team sport I picked up at university, and have been playing ever since. It is great exercise, and I really enjoy being part of a team. I play for Thundering Herd, a mixed-gender team based in Clapham. I am also learning to play the guitar in my spare time.
<br><br>
As expected from someone with a career in IT, I am interested in computing and technology. I spent a lot of time growing up designing and creating websites using HTML, and I am currently administering and developing the website of UK Ultimate (the UK’s governing body for Ultimate Frisbee), which is based on the Drupal CRM framework and a MySQL database. I have become competent in writing code in php and using SQL through this endeavor. I am also writing a test suite for that site using the Cucumber Ruby gem.
